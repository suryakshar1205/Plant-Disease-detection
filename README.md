# Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture

This project is a **Plant Disease Detection System** that uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify plant diseases based on images of leaves. The system helps farmers detect diseases early and take appropriate actions, promoting sustainable agriculture practices. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

This project leverages deep learning for classifying plant diseases from images. It uses a CNN model that has been trained to recognize various plant diseases from a dataset. The system allows users to upload images of plants, which the model then analyzes to identify possible diseases.

### Key Features:
- Web interface built using **Streamlit** for user interaction.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** based deep learning model for disease prediction.
- Pre-trained model for quick predictions on plant images.
- Image dataset for training, validation, and testing.
- Visualization of accuracy and confusion matrix for model evaluation.

## Features

- **Disease Recognition**: Upload an image of a plant leaf, and the model predicts the disease.
- **Live Prediction**: Predict the disease of the plant in real-time using the uploaded image.
- **Accuracy Visualization**: Shows the accuracy of the trained model using training and validation data.
## Dataset
-The dataset used for training the model is available on Kaggle under the name 'New Plant Diseases Dataset' by Samir Bhattarai.
